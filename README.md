# ShopAltruism

People who live comfortable lives are often disconnected from the conditions and realities of people living in third
world countries. ShopAltruism aims to help online shoppers gain a better sense of how far their dollar actually goes,
by replacing dollar prices with more meaningful metrics, such as 'hours of child labor', 'pounds of rice', and more.
ShopAltruism also encourages users to donate, by opening a donation tab every time a user adds a product to their cart.
